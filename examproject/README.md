# Exam project 

The **results** of this project can be seen from running the notebook exam_2024.ipynb. To arrive at the solutions, the py-files Question1.py, Question2.py, and Question3.py are used. 
 
**Description of use of ChatGPT:** In general we have used ChatGPT to help us locate mistakes in the code. We have used ChatGPT to write the first draft for a chunk of code in some of the questions, which we have then adjusted. When this is the case, we have indicated it in the notebook/py-file.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
