    "$K_{t}, L_{t}$ and $A_{t}$ are defined as for the baseline Solow model. $E_{t}$ is the exhaustable resource (ie. oil) and $D_{t}$ is climate change. It is assumed that climate change reduces production by one portion $(D_{t})$, that is, a damaged part of production $(D_{t}Y_{t})$ is lost, and the portion $(1-D_{t})$ of productions \"survives\" for consumption and investment. The degree of climate change depend on how much of the exhaustable ressource $(E_t)$ has been consumed. Each period the fraction $s_{E}$ of the exhaustable resource is consumed."
