# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solow model with exhaustible natural ressource and climate change** and is about the transition path in an economy characterized by having an exhaustible natural ressource - e.g., oil - which is an input factor in the production function, but in future periods leads to lower production due to climate change. The project is inspired by an exam set (Macroeconomics I 2019 reexamination  at UCPH). 

In the project the transition path of the Solow model with exhaustible natural ressource and climate change is compared to the standard Solow model. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
